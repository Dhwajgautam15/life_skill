# TITLE: SOLID 
## ABSTRACT: 
SOLID is a popular set of design principles that are used in object-oriented software development. SOLID is an acronym that stands for five key design principles: single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle, and dependency inversion principle. 
### Introduction :
Robert C. Martin defined the SOLID principles in a 2000 essay titled "Design Principles and Design Patterns," but Michael Feathers invented the acronym later. To counteract these problematic design patterns, the SOLID principles were established.
 ### Single Responsibility Principle : 
The single responsibility concept is a simple notion that most developers use while writing code. It is useful for classes, software components, and microservices. Using this idea makes code easier to test and maintain, software easier to create, and it aids in avoiding unexpected side effects of future modifications.
### Open-Closed Principle : 
The open-closed concept states that existing, well-tested classes must be updated when adding anything new. This guideline must be followed while developing code that is easy to maintain and revise. 
### Liskov Substitution Principle :
The Liskov Substitution Principle is likely the most hardest of the five SOLID concepts to grasp. Liskov expresses the idea in her own words:
What is desired here is something like the substitution property: if there is an object O2 of type T for each object O1 of type S such that for all programs P specified in terms of T, the behavior of P remains unaltered when O1 is swapped for O2, then S is a subtype of T.
### Interface Segregation Principle :
The main notion behind the interface segregation principle is that having a number of smaller interfaces is preferable to a few larger ones This means that software programmers should not just start with an existing interface and add new methods. 
### Dependency Inversion Principle :
This idea provides a method for decoupling software units. Expressed, the dependency inversion concept states that developers should "depend on abstractions, not concretions.
